# WeMod Deck
**For Windows user only. Doesn't support SteamOS.**  
Free tier of [WeMod](https://www.wemod.com) doesn't allow toggling cheats with UI, only with hotkeys. But most Steam Deck users don't have keyboard available so it's almost impossible to toggle cheats.  
This AutoHotkey script solves that problem by generating interactable UI for WeMod trainers.

## Installation  
1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/wemod-deck/wemod-deck/releases/) and extract it into a folder.  
2. Install [AutoHotkey (Current Version)](https://autohotkey.com).  

## Usage
1. Run `wemod-deck.ahk`.  
2. Log in with your WeMod account.  
3. Find the game trainer on [WeMod Game List](https://www.wemod.com/cheats), copy its URL and paste it into WeMod Deck. For example: https://www.wemod.com/cheats/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-trainers  
4. Press `Generate Trainer`.
5. Open the generated file in `trainers` folder.  
6. Press `Run game with WeMod` to start the game.  
7. Wait for the game to load, then click on the buttons to toggle cheats.
